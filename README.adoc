= Spring Boot Kotlin Native example (with Gradle)

Simple showcase of Spring Boot Native compilation for Kotlin projects.

== Issues

== Private methods in RestController(s) are not detected

The class had to be explicitly added as a Hint (See class `AppNativeHints`).

```kotlin
hints.reflection()
        .registerType(HelloController::class.java, MemberCategory.INVOKE_DECLARED_METHODS)
```

Private methods in `@Component` services are fine.


NOTE: Private methods in Kotlin are `KCallable`, not normal Java `Method`.
Trying to list it to only register it did not work.
